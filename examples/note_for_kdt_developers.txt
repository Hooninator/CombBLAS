Place running example code here.

Note that kdt must be in your Python search path.
If you're doing active development and don't want to continually install new
kdt builds then point the PYTHONPATH environment variable at the svn trunk:
$ export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/kdt/svn/trunk
(that's ../ from where this file is)


For Hopper runs, in the parent folder:

> module load python
> setenv CC cc
> setenv CXX CC
> python setup.py build
> python setup.py install --home=$HOME
> setenv PYTHONPATH $HOME":$HOME/kdt/trunk"
