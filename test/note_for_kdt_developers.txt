Place running example code here.

Note that kdt must be in your Python search path.
If you're doing active development and don't want to continually install new
kdt builds then point the PYTHONPATH environment variable at the svn trunk:
$ export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/kdt/svn/trunk
(that's ../ from where this file is)
