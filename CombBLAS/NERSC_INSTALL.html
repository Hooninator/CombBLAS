Combinatorial BLAS compilation instructions for <a href="http://www.nersc.gov/">NERSC</a> resources.
<br><br>
1- First and foremost, make cmake active by running: <em> module load cmake </em> <br>
2- In your CombBLAS_xx directory, rename CMakeLists_NERSC.txt to CMakeLists.txt, replacing the existing one. <br>
3- module load gcc/4.8.0

Now run <em>"cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=ToolChain.Cray ."</em> , followed by <em>"make"</em> <br> <br>
<br><br>
For tests, you might want to run them through the interactive batch system via <br>
> "salloc -N 2 -p debug -t 00:30:00" <br>
> "ctest -V"
> or just run a single test: "cd Applications; srun -n 36 ./dobfs 23"
